<br> 🚀 Senior Engineer | AI & Cloud Solutions | Generative AI | LLM  
<p>I am a passionate and results-driven Software Engineer with over 8 years of experience in designing, developing, and deploying robust applications across the healthcare, medical device, energy, and utility domains. Currently working as Engineer 3 at Thermo Fisher Scientific, I specialize in building scalable, secure, and high-performance solutions that integrate seamlessly with complex ecosystems, including IoT devices, LIS, EMR systems, and cloud services.

<p>👨‍💻Throughout my career, I have demonstrated expertise in .NET/.NET Core, C#, AMQP, MQTT, Azure, GCP, SQL Server, MongoDB, and event-driven microservice architectures. My work has spanned end-to-end product development, from integrating medical devices and healthcare systems to building smart energy grid solutions and implementing real-time data pipelines.

<p>🗺️ I take pride in delivering impactful projects such as:

Developing and testing end-to-end software for allergy and autoimmune testing systems at Thermo Fisher.

Leading modules for Intelliport Gateway at Becton Dickinson, integrating IoT devices and EMRs while implementing observability solutions using CNCF technologies (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana).

Building healthcare interoperability platforms at MediAssist, ensuring seamless payer integrations.

Designing and deploying IoT-based energy and utility solutions at EsyaSoft Technologies.

<p>I hold an M.Tech in Software Engineering from BITS Pilani and a B.Tech in Computer Science from Rajasthan Technical University. Beyond work, I enjoy cricket, cooking, and traveling, which keep me energized and balanced.

I thrive in environments where innovation meets real-world impact and aspire to continue contributing to transformative solutions in healthcare and technology-driven domains.
